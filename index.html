			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>The parrotfeather, or Myriophyllum aquaticum (pictured right) is an invasive aquatic plant originally from the Amazon river that has spread across the world. Initially chosen to be decorative, it has quickly spread to lakes and waterways due to a lack of natural predators harming both the ecology of those ecosystems and in some extreme cases the economy of where it has invaded. Worst of all, parrotfeather is incredibly difficult to control, causing current colonies to prosper mostly unhindered.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>Habitat</h1>
			<p>The parrotfeather lives in slow-moving or still freshwater bodies such as ponds, rivers, lakes, and canals. While it flourishes in shallow water, by growing from banks or edges of bodies of water parrotfeather is able to survive in deeper water and handle fluctuations in the water level. It is also important to note that parrotfeather will both prefer to live in and is more likely to take over nutrient-dense environments. This being said, parrotfeather is known to live in more nutrient-bare bodies of water.</p>

			<h1>Distribution</h1>
			<p>Although Native to the Amazon river, parrotfeather has spread worldwide due to humans using it to decorate garden ponds. While restrictions have been placed on moving it, it has still spread to every continent but Antarctica. As seen in the image to the left, parrotfeather has spread to New England. While it isnâ€™t a problem in Massachusetts yet, Massachusetts is regulating it to help prevent it from becoming one.

			<h1>Damage Caused</h1>
			<p>Parrotfeather, like most invasive species, outcompetes water plants native to the area, taking over large sections of rivers, ponds, and other freshwater bodies. While the ecological damage of this is yet to be calculated, it has already caused issues with shipping and boating by clogging up waterways. On top of this, they serve as a breeding ground for mosquitos, heavily increasing the mosquito population. Removal of parrotfeather is also very expensive, leading to financial damages.</p>
